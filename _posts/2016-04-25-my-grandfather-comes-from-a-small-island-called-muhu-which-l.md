description: 'My grandfather comes from a small island called Muhu which lies off the west coast of Estonia. He is a proud descendant of fierce Estonian Vikings. On the other side of my family, my grandmother comes from the coast of the White Sea. She can trace her roots back to the Nenets people of Siberia. I feel that my ancestorâ€™s genes are responsible for me having such a deep need of being close to nature and its power.'

My grandfather comes from a small island called Muhu which lies off the west coast of Estonia. He is a proud descendant of fierce Estonian Vikings. On the other side of my family, my grandmother comes from the coast of the White Sea. She can trace her roots back to the Nenets people of Siberia. I feel that my ancestor's genes are responsible for me having such a deep need of being close to nature and its power.

The animals living around me were my favourite playmates when I was growing up on a farm. There weren't many other children in the village near where I grew up. 

My best friends were horses and sometimes I took my bike and cycled long kilometres to spend a day on the meadow with them. I also liked to lay down in the grass, and watch the clouds float above my head.

After long travels, having two beautiful children, going through all sorts of life adventures - I now find myself in Ireland. I believe the magic and powerful nature of this land awakened my dormant fairytale world and its creatures who were finally ready to leap on the sheets of paper. 

My inspiration comes from all around me; it can be a sound, a smell, some packets of overheard conversation, a dream or even a medieval tapestry. Our world is full of secret messages and clues, some of which are there for us to find, if we look in the right places. I feel that I have a connection with the land which allows me to access these secrets. I am a proud, yet humble daughter of Mother Earth.

Yours Irena Tammik
